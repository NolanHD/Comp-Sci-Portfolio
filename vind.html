               Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. You have to take the control of a legendary hero 
               using the programming language of your choice. You will fight with other AI for a predetermined number of turns a
               nd the hero with the greatest amount of gold will win. There are three main objectives that are needed to win. 
               The first one is claiming mines. When mines are claimed you get a set amount of gold per turn when holding on to them.
               You can kill other players by standing next to them and claim all of their current claimed mines. When you claim mines 
               because they are defended by goblins, it takes some of your health. To go heal, you can go to taverns located around the map
               and heal 70 health a turn. Healing costs gold also and its not smart to always stand next to a tavern because
               you need the most gold to win after all! There are 1200 turns per game and your code is run each turn. To decide what 
               you will do. This is a basic form of AI and that is what we're trying to take away from this.
                </p>


            <h2 class="subject-header" id="special"> My Bot </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My bot is a very basic form of AI. In this game, Vindinium it does 3 things, collect mines, go to taverns and attack other enemy
                bots. For the task "freemines" it runs a for loops that compares the distances of mines
                to find the closest mine by comparing distances of mines and checking each time the for loop is run. The ability
                that my bot has is going to a tavern when it goes below 60 health. It
                decides this by running a for loop and comparing the distances of the taverns and ultimately going to the 
                closest one. The ablity my bot has is attacking enemy bots. This is done by a for loop again.
                The for loop decides what the nearest enemy bot is by again running a for loop and comparing all of the distances of the bots each time
                it runs the for loop. When all of these loops are run they path the bot to the target and console log whatever they're doing.

    <h1 class="subject-header"> What I learned about AI</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"> 
    This project was a very enjoyable and educational experience. I learned a lot about basic AI coding and it turned out to be a lot easier 
    than I had expected AI to be. AI to me has changed from something almost incomprehensible to something that almost makes sense. 
    I realized that this basic AI is just a bunch of for loops running checks on things. In conclusion, I think that 
    everyone has something that they can take away from this and that I'm capable of anything if I put my mind to it.
